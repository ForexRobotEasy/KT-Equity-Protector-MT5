# KT Equity Protector MT5

## Description

This code is for the KT Equity Protector MT5 program developed by Forex Robot Easy Team. This program is designed to monitor the account equity and close all market orders and delete pending orders if the equity reaches either the stop loss or profit target values.

The program uses the Trade library to interact with the trading platform and perform trading operations. The stop loss and profit target values are defined as constants in the code. The program continuously monitors the account equity every second and checks if it reaches the stop loss or profit target. If either condition is met, all market orders are closed and all pending orders are deleted.
